# Ruby Exercises and Terminology 
[Link to exercises](https://github.com/cruzgerman216/CodeLabs-Ruby-on-Rails-Exercises) <br>
Here is a list of ruby terms and definitions used in class.

## Part 1 
<em>**Layer of Abstraction**</em> - "Abstraction is how you hide irrelevant details and represent only the essential features." Data abstraction hides details about data and control abstraction is "hiding implementation details." Functions are one way this is acheived. https://ecomputernotes.com/cpp/classes-in-c/type-of-abstraction<br>
<em>**Data Type**</em> - a classification of data. Ex: integer, string, boolean, hash, array <br>
<em>**Variable**</em> - a way to label and store information <br>
<em>**What's the difference between a local variable, constant variable, and a global variable?**</em> - Local variables are variables available in their current scope and can be changed. Constant variables have local scope and cannot be changed.A global variable is available globally.  <br>
<em>**What does scope mean?**</em> - scope is a level or place in the program that things are available. Global or local.   <br>
<em>**Constant Variable**</em> - a variable that has local scope and cannot be changed. <br>
<em>**Method**</em> - a function. Some code that performs some set task(s). Can take in an argument & perform the tasks in relation to or on the argument.  <br>
<em>**IRB**</em> - interactive Ruby - a "way to explore the Ruby language & try out code without creating a file." https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-irb-to-explore-ruby <br>
<em>**Operators**</em> - character(s) that determine what action is going to be done. There are 3 types: mathematical, comparison, logical. https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zb3yb82/revision/5#:~:text=An%20operator%20is%20a%20character,of%20operator%20that%20programmers%20use%3A&text=comparison%20operators,logical%20operators <br>
<em>**Class**</em> - a template or blueprint created by the programmer for creating objects https://brilliant.org/wiki/classes-oop/ <br>
<em>**Gem**</em> - a library, extension, or package. <br>

## Part 2
<em>**Conditional**</em> - Subject to requirements being met, like in a conditional statement. (If/else statements) <br>
<em>**The difference between if, elseif and else.**</em> - <em>**IF**</em> a condition is met, the code block will run.
<em>**ELSE IF**</em> the first condition was not met, but then this condition is met, this code block will run.<br>
<em>**ELSE**</em> if the condition(s) is/are NOT met, this code block will run.
<em>**What are Case/When statements?**</em> - A type of if/else statement version. You can work with a single variable, your "case", and when certain conditions are true the code block runs.  <br>
<em>**What is a data structure?**</em> - Data structures are ways to organize data, like an array or a hash. <br>
<em>**Arrays**</em> - A set of information contained within square brackets [], ordered with an index that starts at 0. <br>
<em>**What is meant by 'built-in' methods?**</em> - built in methods are methods that are already built into the language. There are various methods you can use like join, pop, push, etc.  <br>
<em>**Loops**</em> - a way you can iterate over data, or run the same block of code over and over again until a condition is met, until the code has run a specific number of times, or until the end of the data.<br>
<em>**What are infinite loops?**</em> - Loops that haven't been built properly so the loop is never exited. <br>
